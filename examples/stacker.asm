Stacker

; STRATEGY: cautious patrol with a sweeping gun.
; STACK LESSON: CALL/RET share the stack with saved register values.
; Every helper restores its saved registers in reverse order before RET.
; Nested calls reach 11 stack entries, safely below the 64-entry limit.
; A routine may span CPU ticks: its stack remains intact between ticks.
;
; Main owns R6 (completed patrol/gun passes) and R7 (cruise speed).
; drive and combat preserve R0..R3 as described at their entry points.
